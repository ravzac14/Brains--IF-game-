1. User input for character selection is now validated by comparing either the first or second letter of their against a series of if statements to shorten code.

example:  
elif whichGame[0]=="Z" or "z" or "h" or "H" or whichGame[0]=="L":
    class zackGame(game.zackGame):
        pass

Will check to see if the first letter the user input starts with a "z" or "h" or "l" as in "zack" or "hard" or "legendery" respectively.
